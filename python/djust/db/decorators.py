"""
``@notify_on_save`` and ``send_pg_notify`` — emit PostgreSQL ``NOTIFY``
statements from Django signals or arbitrary code paths.

The decorator is a zero-config wrapper: slap it on a model and every
``save()`` / ``delete()`` sends a minimal JSON payload to a channel. Any
``LiveView`` that called ``self.listen(<channel>)`` in ``mount()`` will
receive a ``db_notify`` message and its ``handle_info()`` will fire.

Design decisions (see pipeline plan for rationale):

* Payload is minimal: ``{"pk": ..., "event": "save"|"delete", "model": ...}``.
  Receivers re-fetch if they need more state.
* Channel name defaults to ``{app_label}_{model_name}`` but can be
  overridden via ``@notify_on_save(channel="orders")``.
* Channel names are strictly validated against ``^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,62}$``.
  This is security-critical: Postgres ``NOTIFY`` does NOT accept bind
  parameters for the channel name, so the regex is the only defense
  against SQL injection.
* Non-postgres backends no-op with a debug log — the same ``@notify_on_save``
  decorated model works in sqlite test suites.
