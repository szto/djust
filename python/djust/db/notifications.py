"""
``PostgresNotifyListener`` — process-wide async LISTEN consumer that
bridges PostgreSQL pg_notify events into Django Channels group messages.

Architecture:

* One listener per Django process. Lazy-started on the first call to
  ``ensure_listening(channel)`` (typically triggered by a view's
  ``self.listen()`` in ``mount``).
* The listener runs in a dedicated asyncio task on a **separate** psycopg
  ``AsyncConnection`` — not Django's connection pool. Long-lived LISTEN
  connections don't play nice with pgbouncer transaction pooling.
* Each NOTIFY is forwarded to ``channel_layer.group_send(
  f"djust_db_notify_{channel}", {"type": "db_notify", ...})``. The
  ``LiveViewConsumer.db_notify`` handler re-renders affected views.
* Connection drops are handled by reconnecting after a 1-second backoff
  and re-issuing LISTEN for every subscribed channel. Notifications
  missed during the drop window are lost — callers recover via the
  normal ``mount()`` re-fetch on WS reconnect. This limitation is
  documented in ``docs/website/guides/database-notifications.md``.
* **Event-loop binding (issue #808).** ``_ensure_task_started`` captures
  the running loop on the first call to ``ensure_listening()``. All
  subsequent coroutine calls that touch ``self._conn`` (``_listen_on``,
  the ``_run`` iterator, cancellation from ``areset_for_tests``) MUST
  execute on that same loop — psycopg's ``AsyncConnection`` is not
  safe to share across loops. If a second loop calls
  ``ensure_listening()`` (e.g. from ``async_to_sync`` running in a
  worker thread with its own event loop), the call is rejected with a
  ``RuntimeError`` rather than silently racing against the listener
  loop. Practical consequence: the singleton should be used from the
  ASGI worker's main event loop — which is the common path —
  ``self.listen(channel)`` from a LiveView's ``mount()`` is the
  supported entry point.
