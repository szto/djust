"""HTTP streaming foundation for v0.9.0 Phase 2 (ADR-015).

Owns the :class:`ChunkEmitter` abstraction that
:meth:`TemplateMixin.arender_chunks` and :meth:`RequestMixin.aget` use to
ship shell-then-body chunks over a ``StreamingHttpResponse``. PR-A
foundation; PR-B (``lazy=True``) and PR-C (``asyncio.as_completed``)
build on this.

The emitter provides three responsibilities:

1. **Backpressure** — chunks are pushed onto a bounded
   :class:`asyncio.Queue`. When the queue is full, ``emit()`` awaits
   until the consumer drains a chunk.
2. **Cancellation** — a single ``cancel()`` method propagates a stop
   signal to all in-flight thunks via a per-request token plus a
   ``cancelled`` flag, used by the ASGI disconnect handler in
   :meth:`RequestMixin.aget`.
3. **Lazy thunk registry** — a placeholder API surface
   (:meth:`register_thunk`) used by PR-B's ``{% live_render lazy=True %}``
   tag. PR-A does not invoke any thunks; it only wires the registry so
   the contract is locked in advance.

The emitter is per-request: a fresh instance is constructed inside
:meth:`RequestMixin.aget` and stashed on the LiveView instance as
``self._chunk_emitter`` for the duration of that GET.
