# Sensitive-field denylist (finding #19 / CWE-200 / CWE-359).
#
# When a Django Model instance is assigned to a *public* (non-``_``) LiveView
# attribute, every concrete field is auto-serialized and sent to the client.
# Without a denylist this leaks ``password`` hashes, privilege flags, and PII
# the moment a developer writes the very natural ``self.user = request.user``.
#
# ``_ALWAYS_EXCLUDED_FIELDS`` is the secure-by-default floor for the
# *auto-serialization* paths — the full model dump, the JIT empty-paths
# fallback, the state snapshot, and get_state — where a whole Model is
# serialized without the developer naming any field. On those paths these names
# are dropped regardless of settings AND regardless of a per-model
# ``djust_serializable_fields`` allowlist (#1868: the floor is UNCONDITIONAL —
# an allowlist may only NARROW the serialized set, never re-expose a floor
# field). The ONLY way to re-include a floor field is the deliberate, loudly
# named per-model ``djust_serialize_sensitive_fields`` opt-out — a developer
# must explicitly take ownership of shipping ``password``/privilege flags.
# It does NOT (and cannot) cover a template that *explicitly* references a
# field: ``{{ user.password }}`` flows through the compiled JIT serializer,
# which emits exactly the paths the template names — that is a
# developer-initiated disclosure which already renders into server-side HTML.
# The match is name-EXACT: it covers ``password`` but not a ``get_password()``
# accessor or a differently-named ``@property`` — use ``DJUST_SENSITIVE_FIELDS``
# / per-model ``djust_exclude_fields`` for those.
# ``DJUST_SENSITIVE_FIELDS`` (settings) is UNIONED with this floor for
# project-wide additions. Per-model ``djust_exclude_fields`` (denylist) and
# ``djust_serializable_fields`` (allowlist) give developers field-level control;
# a model-level ``to_dict()`` is the full opt-out (developer takes ownership of
# what ships to the client).
#
# The floor covers Django's auth model: the ``password`` hash plus the privilege
# flags (``is_superuser``/``is_staff``) — all explicitly called out in finding
# #19 as leaked to the browser via ``self.user = request.user``.

    template getattr sidecar (ADR-024 / #1986 review).

    The Rust template engine's sidecar walk resolves ``{{ obj.attr }}`` by raw
    ``getattr`` on live model instances — the fallback that lets reverse
    relations, managers, and methods the eager dict can't hold still render.
    Without this wrapper that walk **bypasses the serialization floor**
    (``_ALWAYS_EXCLUDED_FIELDS`` / ``DJUST_SENSITIVE_FIELDS`` / per-model
    ``djust_exclude_fields``, SECURE_DEFAULTS Pattern 1), leaking
    ``password`` / ``is_superuser`` / ``get_session_auth_hash`` to the client
    (both for explicitly-assigned models and request-scoped ``user``).

    The proxy refuses exactly what the eager path (``DjangoJSONEncoder``)
    refuses — the same field floor/allowlist via ``_field_is_serializable``
    and the same sensitive-method set — so ONE authority governs both the
    eager and the sidecar channel (#1646). Refused names raise
    ``AttributeError``; the Rust walk turns that into an empty render
    (Django's ``string_if_invalid`` default).

    Three defenses, all needed (each closed a distinct #1986-review bypass):

    1. **Field/method floor** on ``__getattr__`` — direct
       ``{{ member.password }}`` / ``{{ member.get_session_auth_hash }}``.
    2. **Transitive protection** of every returned value via
       ``_protect_sidecar_value`` — a model or manager/queryset reached deeper
       in the walk (``{{ x.groups.first.user_set.first.password }}``,
       ``{% for u in qs %}``) is itself wrapped, so it can't leak.
    3. **``__djust_serialize__``** returns a denylist-filtered dict
       (``normalize_django_value``, the SAME serializer the eager path uses),
       which the Rust ``FromPyObject`` calls instead of bulk-dumping the raw
       model's ``__dict__`` (that dump — ``lib.rs`` — filtered only
       ``_``-prefixed keys, so it leaked ``password`` for any model converted
       to a value, e.g. queryset items in a ``{% for %}``).

    ``_``-prefixed names are refused outright (Django-parity: template
    resolution never touches them) — this also closes the ``{{ obj._meta }}``
    worker segfault + ``{{ obj._meta.db_table }}`` schema disclosure. Safe
    fields, ``get_full_name``, managers, and relations delegate transparently,
    so Django-parity auto-call still works.

    Type-based field exclusion (e.g. always-drop ``BinaryField``) is a
    separate follow-up (#1987) that hardens both serialization paths.

    speedup when called in hot paths (context serialization, state sync).

    **Enhancements beyond DjangoJSONEncoder**: the following types would raise
    ``TypeError`` under ``json.dumps(value, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder)`` but are
    handled here as a convenience:

    - timedelta  -- ISO-8601 duration string (via ``django.utils.duration``)

    **Non-serializable values (issue #292)**: If a value cannot be serialized,
    this function logs a warning and falls back to str(value). Configure
    ``strict_serialization=True`` in LIVEVIEW_CONFIG to raise TypeError instead.
    Always emits warning logs before fallback, even when not in strict mode.

    Supported types:
    - None, bool, int, float, str  -- pass through
    - Decimal                      -- float()

    - timedelta                    -- ISO-8601 duration string (via Django util)
    - Promise (lazy strings)       -- str()
    - dict                         -- recurse values
    - list / tuple                 -- recurse elements (always returns list)
    - Django Model                 -- serialized via DjangoJSONEncoder._serialize_model_safely, then recursed
    - QuerySet                     -- list of normalized models
    - FieldFile / file-like        -- .url or None
    - Component / LiveComponent    -- str() (renders HTML)

# (which does NOT re-run ``mount()``). The session is JSON-serialized, so a live
# model can't be stored as-is; the old path ran ``normalize_django_value`` over
# private state, which turned the model into the LOSSY *client* dict
# (``{"pk", "__str__", <fields>}``) — so on restore ``self._workspace`` came back
# a plain ``dict`` and ``self._workspace.memberships`` raised ``AttributeError``.
#
# Instead, encode each model as a re-hydratable REFERENCE and re-fetch it from
# the DB on restore, so a private model attr round-trips AS A MODEL. Private
# state is server-side view cache, not client-bound payload — the serialization
# floor does not apply here (nothing is sent to the client).
