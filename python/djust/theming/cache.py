CSS generation cache utilities.

All CSS generation convenience functions use ``functools.lru_cache`` so that
identical (theme_name, color_preset) / pack_name / design-system combinations
return the cached string on subsequent calls instead of rebuilding CSS from
scratch every time.

Call ``clear_css_cache()`` during development (or from a management command)
to force regeneration after modifying theme definitions.

    """Clear all CSS generation caches.

    Calls ``cache_clear()`` on every cached convenience function:

    * ``css_generator.generate_theme_css``
    * ``theme_css_generator.generate_theme_css``
    * ``pack_css_generator.generate_pack_css``
    * ``design_system_css.generate_design_system_css``

    Safe to call at any time; subsequent CSS generation calls will simply
    repopulate the cache on demand.
