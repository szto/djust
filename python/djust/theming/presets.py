"""
Theme preset definitions using HSL color tokens.

Based on shadcn/ui theming system with CSS custom properties.
Each preset is defined in its own file under themes/.

Note: the dataclass types (``ColorScale``, ``ThemeTokens``, ``SurfaceTreatment``,
``ThemePreset``) now live in ``_types.py`` so that ``themes/_base.py`` can
import them without going back through this module — avoiding the cyclic
import that CodeQL's ``py/unsafe-cyclic-import`` flagged across ~55 theme
files. They are re-exported from this module for backward compatibility so
existing consumers like ``from djust.theming.presets import ColorScale``
keep working unchanged.
