AsyncWorkMixin — Background work with immediate UI feedback for LiveView.

Allows event handlers to flush state to the client, then run slow work
in a background thread. When the work completes, the view re-renders
and sends updated patches to the client.

        Schedule a callback to run **once, after the current render+patch
        cycle** completes. Phoenix-style ``send(self(), :foo)`` semantics —
        useful for telemetry, post-render cleanup, or follow-up side
        effects that should fire after the user sees the change.

        Unlike :meth:`start_async`, ``defer``:

        * Runs synchronously in the same WebSocket message cycle (not in a
          background thread).
        * Does NOT trigger a re-render after the callback returns.
        * Is fire-once — every call appends to a queue that is drained and
          cleared after each ``_send_update`` returns.

        If the callback raises, the exception is logged at WARN with full
        traceback and execution continues to the next deferred callback —
        a deferred callback's failure must not break the WebSocket
        connection or the user's interactive flow.

        Async callbacks (``async def`` or coroutine-returning) are
        awaited inline, mirroring the existing
        :meth:`~djust.mixins.async_work.AsyncWorkMixin.start_async`
        async-detection pattern.

        Reentry semantics (calling ``defer()`` from a deferred callback):

            A callback that itself calls ``self.defer(other_cb)`` queues
            ``other_cb`` for the **next** render+patch cycle, NOT the
            current drain. This matches Phoenix ``send(self(), :foo)``
            semantics — the message is processed after the current handler
            returns. Implementation: :meth:`_drain_deferred` clears
            ``self._deferred_callbacks`` BEFORE iterating the snapshot, so
            re-entry into ``defer()`` writes to a fresh empty queue. This
            avoids unbounded loops (a callback that re-defers itself does
            NOT spin within a single drain) and gives users a predictable
            "next tick" mental model.

        Args:
            callback: Callable (typically a method on this view).
            *args: Positional arguments passed to the callback.
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments passed to the callback.

        replaced with ``AsyncResult.succeeded(result)`` (or
        ``AsyncResult.errored(exc)`` on failure) and the view re-renders.

        Both synchronous and ``async def`` loaders are supported — coroutine
