"""
LayoutMixin — Runtime layout switching for LiveView (v0.6.0).

Lets an event handler swap the surrounding layout template (nav, sidebar,
footer, etc.) without a full page reload, preserving the inner LiveView
state::

    class EditorView(LiveView):
        template_name = "editor/page.html"

        @event_handler
        def enter_fullscreen(self, **kwargs):
            self.fullscreen = True
            self.set_layout("layouts/fullscreen.html")

        @event_handler
        def exit_fullscreen(self, **kwargs):
            self.fullscreen = False
            self.set_layout("layouts/app.html")

The mixin queues a pending layout path; the WebSocket consumer drains the
queue after the next ``_send_update`` and emits a discrete
``{"type": "layout", "path": ..., "html": ...}`` frame. The client then
swaps the document body while preserving the live ``[dj-root]`` element's
identity (and therefore all inner LiveView state — form values, scroll
position, focused elements, dj-hook bookkeeping).

Phoenix 1.1 added runtime layout support; this is the djust equivalent.
