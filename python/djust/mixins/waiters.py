WaiterMixin — ``await self.wait_for_event(...)`` primitive.

ADR-002 Phase 1b. Lets a ``@background`` handler suspend until a
specific user-triggered event handler runs, with optional predicate
filtering and timeout. The core building block for :class:`TutorialMixin`
(Phase 1c) and for any server-driven flow that needs to pause mid-plan
until the user actually performs an action.

Usage::

    from djust.decorators import event_handler, background

    class Onboarding(LiveView):
        @event_handler
        @background
        async def start_tour(self, **kwargs):
            self.push_commands(JS.add_class("tour-highlight", to="#btn-new"))
            try:
                # Pause until the user clicks the button (fires the
                # create_project event handler) — or give up after 60s.
                result = await self.wait_for_event("create_project", timeout=60)
            except TimeoutError:
                self.push_commands(JS.remove_class("tour-highlight", to="#btn-new"))
                self.tour_abandoned = True
                return
            self.push_commands(JS.remove_class("tour-highlight", to="#btn-new"))
            # result is the kwargs dict that was passed to create_project
            self.project_name = result.get("name", "")

Design notes
------------

Waiters live on the view instance in a ``_waiters: Dict[str, List[_Waiter]]``
dict keyed by event name. Each ``_Waiter`` carries an ``asyncio.Event``
(for signalling) and a payload slot (filled when the waiter resolves).
Notify is O(#waiters for this event name) per handler call, which is
typically 0 or 1. Cleanup happens inline when a waiter resolves or
times out — no garbage collection pass needed.

The mixin is thread-safe only in the sense that asyncio's single-threaded
event loop guarantees ordered execution of the async code here. Do not
call ``wait_for_event`` from a non-async context — it must be awaited.

Predicates are called with the kwargs dict that was passed to the
handler. A predicate that raises is treated as False (the waiter
doesn't resolve for that kwargs call) and the raised exception is
logged via the ``djust.waiters`` logger. This preserves the invariant
that a bad predicate can't crash the event pipeline.

Waiters created during a handler call are **not** notified for that
same call — the notify pass runs AFTER the handler completes and
inspects the waiter dict at that moment, so a new waiter won't see
the current event. This prevents re-entrancy surprises where
``wait_for_event("X")`` inside an ``X`` handler would resolve
against itself.

        Suspend until an ``@event_handler`` named ``name`` is called.

        Args:
            name: The name of the event handler to wait for. Must match
                the method name exactly (e.g. ``"create_project"``).
            timeout: Optional seconds to wait before giving up. When
                the timeout elapses, raises ``asyncio.TimeoutError``.
                ``None`` (the default) waits indefinitely.
            predicate: Optional callable taking the handler's kwargs
                dict and returning ``True`` to resolve the waiter or
                ``False`` to keep waiting. Useful for "wait until the
                user clicks *this specific* button" when multiple
                events might fire the same handler with different
                arguments. A predicate that raises is treated as
                ``False`` and the exception is logged.

        Returns:
            The kwargs dict passed to the matching handler.

        Raises:
            asyncio.TimeoutError: If ``timeout`` elapses before a
                matching event is seen.

        Example:
