djust framework middleware.

Currently provides:

- :class:`DjustMainOnlyMiddleware` — honors the ``X-Djust-Main-Only: 1``
  request header (sent by the service-worker "instant shell" client) by
  trimming the response body to the inner HTML of the first ``<main>``
  element. All other responses pass through unchanged.

Users register it explicitly in ``MIDDLEWARE``; it is intentionally NOT
added automatically so existing projects are unaffected.

    gains an ``X-Djust-Main-Only-Response: 1`` marker header so clients
