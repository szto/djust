"""Bulk-action progress widget for djust admin.

Provides a LiveView-based progress widget plus a decorator
(``@admin_action_with_progress``) that turns any ``DjustModelAdmin``
action into a background job with a live progress page.

Usage
-----

Define a ModelAdmin action::

    from djust.admin_ext import DjustModelAdmin, site
    from djust.admin_ext.progress import admin_action_with_progress

    @site.register(Article)
    class ArticleAdmin(DjustModelAdmin):
        actions = ["republish_selected"]

        @admin_action_with_progress(description="Republish selected articles")
        def republish_selected(self, request, queryset, progress):
            total = queryset.count()
            for i, article in enumerate(queryset.iterator(), start=1):
                article.publish()
                progress.update(current=i, total=total,
                                message=f"Republished {article.title}")

Known limitation
----------------

The ``_JOBS`` registry is process-local. Under a multi-worker deploy
(Gunicorn/Uvicorn with ``workers>1``) the redirect may land on a
different worker than the one running the background thread, producing
a "Job not found" error on the progress page.  For v0.7.0, run a single
worker (``--workers 1``) or use sticky sessions. The v0.7.1 follow-up
will back ``_JOBS`` with a channel layer so multi-worker deploys work
out of the box.
