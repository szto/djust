File upload support for djust LiveView.

Inspired by Phoenix LiveView's upload API:
- allow_upload() to configure upload slots
- consume_uploaded_entries() to process completed uploads
- Binary WebSocket frames for chunked file transfer
- Client-side preview and progress tracking

Usage:
    class ProfileView(LiveView, UploadMixin):
        template_name = 'profile.html'

        def mount(self, request, **kwargs):
            self.allow_upload('avatar', accept='.jpg,.png,.webp',
                              max_entries=1, max_file_size=5_000_000)

        def handle_event(self, event, params):
            if event == 'save':
                for entry in self.consume_uploaded_entries('avatar'):
                    # Use safe_client_name for the storage key (basename-only,
                    # path-traversal-neutralised). entry.client_name is the RAW
                    # attacker-controlled filename — never put it in a path.
                    path = default_storage.save(
                        f'avatars/{entry.safe_client_name}', entry.file)
                    self.avatar_url = path

Security:
    ``entry.client_name`` is the RAW, attacker-controlled original filename.
    Never use it directly in a storage path/key (``default_storage.save``,
    ``os.path.join``, an object-store key) — that is a path/object-key
    injection sink (CWE-22 / CWE-73). Use ``entry.safe_client_name`` for
    paths. For *display*, ``client_name`` is fine through HTML auto-escaping
    (or ``escape()``) — never render it with ``|safe`` (see system check S007).

    This is the SINGLE source of truth for turning a raw, attacker-controlled

    Both :func:`is_active_content` (the active-content gate) and
    :attr:`UploadEntry.safe_client_name` (the storage-key accessor) call it,
    so the gate inspects EXACTLY the name that will be persisted — no drift
    between "what the gate checked" and "what got stored" (parallel-path
    discipline, #1646). Historically these were two separate code paths and a
    trailing-space filename (``"evil.svg "``) made the gate's
    ``Path(...).suffix`` see ``".svg "`` (miss) while the storage normaliser
    collapsed it back to ``evil.svg`` (a real ``.svg`` on disk) — a
    self-inconsistent bypass.

    Steps (in order):

    1. NFKC-normalise so Unicode compatibility lookalikes (fullwidth solidus
       U+FF0F, division slash U+2215, fullwidth full stop U+FF0E, …) collapse
       to their canonical ASCII separators/dots BEFORE the basename/dot passes
       — otherwise a downstream NFKC layer could re-expand them into real
       ``../../`` traversal.
    2. Drop every Unicode control/format/surrogate/private/unassigned char
       (category starts with "C"): NUL + C0/C1 controls, DEL, zero-width
       chars, bidirectional overrides (U+202E — Trojan-source spoofing).
    3. Map backslashes to "/" (``Path(...).name`` does not split on "\\").
    4. Take the basename (strips every directory component).
    5. ``lstrip(".")`` so the result can't be ``""``, ``"."``, ``".."`` or a
       dotfile.
    6. ``rstrip(". ")`` so trailing dots/spaces (which Windows strips at the
       FS layer, and which would otherwise let ``"evil.svg "`` masquerade as a
       non-svg) are removed.
    7. Collapse a now-empty / whitespace-only result to ``"upload"``.

    string and the filename, so the gate must catch a benign-looking MIME
    with a ``.svg`` name AND a benign-looking name with a ``text/html``
    MIME. The check is metadata-only (no byte inspection), so it works
    identically on the register path and the finalize path and on every
    writer/disk-buffer variant.

    Two normalisation steps close end-to-end bypasses an attacker would
    otherwise drive through the metadata:

    - **MIME parameters are stripped** before the membership check. Browsers
      ignore the ``; charset=...`` / ``; boundary=...`` parameter when
      choosing the renderer, so ``"image/svg+xml; charset=utf-8"`` (and
      ``"image/svg+xml;"``) must be treated as ``image/svg+xml``.
    - **The filename is canonicalised via** :func:`_safe_basename` — the SAME
      transform :attr:`UploadEntry.safe_client_name` uses to derive the
      storage key — before its suffix is taken. This makes the gate inspect
      exactly the name that will be persisted, so a trailing-space/dot name

      check while still landing on disk as an active-content file.

    Lifecycle (all sync):

        1. __init__(upload_id, filename, content_type, expected_size)
           Instantiated per upload on the first chunk.
        2. open()
           Called exactly once, before the first write_chunk(). May raise to
           reject the upload; the exception is passed to abort().
        3. write_chunk(chunk: bytes)
           Called once per WebSocket binary frame with the raw bytes. May
           raise to abort; the exception is passed to abort().
        4. close() -> Any
           Called on successful upload completion. The return value is stored
           on the UploadEntry as ``writer_result`` and is template-accessible

           cancelled, transport disconnected, size limit exceeded). The

    Important guarantees:

    - ``open()`` is called at most once.
    - ``write_chunk()`` is never called before ``open()`` succeeds.
    - After ``close()`` returns, no further methods are invoked.
    - After ``abort()`` returns, no further methods are invoked.
    - Writer instances are isolated per upload — no shared state.
