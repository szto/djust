"""Built-in handler for Django's ``{% regroup %}`` template tag.

``{% regroup <expr> by <attr> as <var> %}`` regroups a flat list into a
list of groups, matching Django's ``defaulttags.RegroupNode`` semantics:

* **Input order is preserved** — grouping is *consecutive* (like
  ``itertools.groupby``), never pre-sorted. Two runs of the same grouper
  separated by a different grouper become *separate* groups, so callers
  must sort upstream if they want one group per key.
* ``<var>`` is bound to ``[{"grouper": key, "list": [item, ...]}, ...]``.
  Templates access ``{{ group.grouper }}`` and ``{% for x in group.list %}``.
* ``<attr>`` supports dotted paths (``author.team``) resolved per item
  against dict keys, sequence indices, and object attributes.

Registered as an *assign* tag handler (``register_assign``): it mutates
the template context rather than emitting HTML. The Rust engine resolves
assign-tag args before calling the handler, JSON-encoding structured
(list/object) values — so ``<expr>`` arrives as a JSON string, which the
handler decodes back into the source records.

Known limitations vs. Django:

* The ``<expr>`` source must resolve to a JSON-encodable sequence
  (django-normalised context values always are). Filter expressions on
  the source (``cities|dictsort:"country"``) are not supported.
* Because djust resolves *all* assign-tag args against the context, a
  top-level context variable whose name exactly matches the ``<attr>``
  token will shadow the per-item lookup. Avoid naming context keys after
  a regroup attribute (Django never resolves the attribute against the
  outer context, so this is a djust-specific edge).
