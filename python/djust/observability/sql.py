"""
Per-event SQL query capture.

When enabled via `capture_for_event()`, a `django.db.connection.execute_wrapper`
intercepts every query fired during handler execution and tags it with
`(session_id, event_id, handler_name)`. The MCP reads the aggregated
log via `/_djust/observability/sql_queries/`.

Unlike Django's own `connection.queries`, this buffer survives across
requests + is event-scoped — so the agent can ask "what SQL did the
increment handler just run?" and get a clean answer.
