"""
Localhost-only gate for the observability endpoint.

These endpoints expose live server state (view assigns, tracebacks,
SQL queries, logs). In DEBUG mode that's acceptable for developer
introspection but we don't want them reachable from the LAN even if
DEBUG slips through to a non-production environment.

The check runs for every request whose path starts with the
OBSERVABILITY_URL_PREFIX. Non-localhost clients get a 403 regardless
of ALLOWED_HOSTS.
