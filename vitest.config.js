/**
 * Test-runtime unhandled-error policy (v0.9.3 — issues #1186 / #1152)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two unhandled-error patterns surface intermittently during the full
 * `make test` run even though every test asserts pass and the suite
 * is otherwise clean. Both are test-runtime cross-pollination noise,
 * not application bugs:
 *
 *   1. happy-dom + undici WebSocket dispatchEvent (#1186, P1):
 *      undici's WebSocket calls `fireEvent` constructing a Node-side
 *      `Event` object; happy-dom's `EventTarget.dispatchEvent` runtime
 *      check rejects it because the two runtimes don't share the
 *      Web-platform Event prototype. The error fires from
 *      `WebSocket.dispatchEvent` deep in node_modules and never
 *      propagates into a test assertion.
 *
 *   2. view-transitions teardown (#1152, P2):
 *      Non-deterministic `EnvironmentTeardownError: Closing rpc while
 *      "onUserConsoleLog" was pending` during teardown of
 *      `tests/js/view-transitions.test.js`. The test stubs already
 *      yield a microtask before invoking the inner callback (per CLAUDE.md
 *      retro #1113), so this is RPC-timing teardown noise, not a stub
 *      regression.
 *
 * Both are filtered here rather than worked around in test files so the
 * suppression is centralized and reviewable. Each pattern matches on
 * narrow `message` + `stack` substrings — anything else still re-throws.
 *
 * TODO(#1186 v0.9.4+): replace WebSocket filter with a proper happy-dom
 * WebSocket stub or upstream-fixed happy-dom version.
